ioBroker zwave Adapter
==============

Zwave support with openzwave.

For this adapter is used rather good supported npm module: https://github.com/OpenZWave/node-openzwave-shared<br>
You should find out what the name has USB port of the Z-Wave stick and setup it in the adapter settings.

## Important Information
- On first run, the Adapter needs some time, to calculate all Objects within iobroker.
- If you add a Device, let the adapter do it's job and wait a little bit.
- If a Device is not visible within the included Admistration Site, it's not fully
imported into ioBroker.


## Installation
First of all, Implemenation is tested only on ARM Linux (e.g. Raspberry Pi (2)).<br>
You need a fully Development Environment (gcc, make,...)

npm install iobroker.zwave does following Steps for you:<br>

- Download and install latest openzwave from github<br>
  \# cd /opt<br>
  \# curl -L -O https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/archive/master.zip<br>
  \# unzip master.zip<br>
  \# cd open-zwave-master<br>
  \# make<br>
  \# sudo make install<br>

After that you have to do the following Steps:<br>

- Put your USB Stick into your Server
- Check whether the system has recognized the USB stick<br>
  \# lsusb<br>
  \# ls -al /dev/ttyA*<br>
  
- Go into iobroker Website and add the Zwave Adapter
- Configure zwave Adapter as described 
- Start the new zwave Adapter instance
- wait<br>
  -- until the Message "zwave.0 Scan completed" is found in iobroker.log<br>
  -- the Object zwave.0.completed has State "true"<br>

## Configuration
Within Admin Settings you can set following Attributes<br>

- Force objects re-init (ReInitialize all Objects within ioBroker)
- USB name (the USB Port of your Z-Wave stick)
- Logging (enable logging to OZW_Log.txt)
- Console Output (copy logging to the console, Logs all to ioBroker.log)
- Save Config (write an XML network layout create a /zwcfg_<HOMEID>.xml on linux)
- Driver Attempts (try this many times before giving up)
- Poll Interval (interval between polls in milliseconds)
- Suppress Refresh (do not send updates if nothing changed)
